# Charleston_Friday_Night_Games
This repository includes a my attempt to create a bot for the CFNG discord server. I am relatively new to creating bots/using an API. Therefore this codebase will look amature. 

I expect things to improve as more people volunteer to help.

No changes will be implemented to the CFNG server until there is approval by both Paul and myself.

Email me if you want access to my testing discord server. 

## Rules

If you would like to publish your own bot or feature, that I have not integrated, please do so in a unique folder:
/yourname/yourcode.
